## 📘 Overview
This project presents a detailed analysis of **weather and air quality data of India** using **Power BI**.  
The dashboard helps visualize important climate parameters such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and AQI (Air Quality Index) for better understanding of environmental patterns.

---

## 🧠 Objectives
- To analyze historical weather trends across Indian regions.  
- To monitor and compare **Air Quality Index (AQI)** over time.  
- To design an **interactive Power BI dashboard** for quick insights and decision-making.  
- To perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** for identifying correlations and seasonal effects.

---

## 🧩 Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI Desktop**
- **Excel / CSV datasets**
- **Power Query Editor**
- **Data Modeling & DAX Formulas**

---

## 📊 Dashboard Features
- Temperature and humidity comparison by city and month.  
- AQI distribution visualization through color-coded charts.  
- Interactive filters for date, region, and pollutant type.  
- Trend lines and KPI cards for quick insights.  
- Dynamic visuals for rainfall and weather condition changes.
